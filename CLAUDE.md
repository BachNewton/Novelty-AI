# Claude Code Instructions

## Environment
- Running on Windows with Git Bash (MINGW)
- Use `/dev/null` instead of `nul` for redirecting output
- Shell is Unix-like, not CMD

## Planning New Features
- Before implementing new training improvements or algorithms, review `EXPERIMENTS.md`
- This document contains past experiments, what worked, and what didn't
- Helps avoid repeating failed approaches and informs design decisions
